These are four small benchmarks, in Forth, in C, and in C generated by
our prototype Forth-to-C-Translator. Typing make in a directory runs
the benchmarks.

You can find a more detailed description of the benchmarks and
a collection of results at
http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/performance.html.

You can find new versions of this collection at
